I know musicians. I wish I was one of them. But thats not what I do. Thats not what this is for. This is a creative playground. There are no rules. Just make something. Or jam on something already made. Anything goes. Play guitar? Cool. Keyboards? Cool. Electronic music, cool. Butt trumpet? Cool. Whatever man. I need to create. If you need to create too, come play.
